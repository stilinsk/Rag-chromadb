Anyone, and I mean anyone, can now\\ndevelop AI applications.\\nBecause of the resources it takes to develop foundation models, this process\\nis possible only for big corporations (Google, Meta, Microsoft, Baidu,\\nTencent), governments (Japan, the UAE), and ambitious, well-funded\\nstartups (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral). In a September 2022 interview, Sam\\nAltman, CEO of OpenAI, said that the biggest opportunity for the vast\\nmajority of people will be to adapt these models for specific applications.\\nThe world is quick to embrace this opportunity. AI engineering has rapidly\\nemerged as one of the fastest, and quite possibly the fastest-growing,\\nengineering discipline. Tools for AI engineering are gaining traction faster\\nthan any previous software engineering tools. Within just two years, four\\nopen source AI engineering tools (AutoGPT, Stable Diffusion eb UI,\\nLangChain, Ollama) have already garnered more stars on GitHub than\\nBitcoin. They are on track to surpass even the most popular web\\ndevelopment frameworks, including React and Vue, in star count. Figure 1-'),\n",

For example, Meta switched from RLHF for\\nLlama 2 to DPO for Llama 3 to reduce complexity. I won’t be able to cover\\nall the different approaches in this book. I choose to feature RLHF instead\\nof DPO here because RLHF, while more complex than DPO, provides more\\nflexibility to tweak the model. Llama 2’s authors posited that “the superior\\nwriting abilities of LLMs, as manifested in surpassing human annotators in\\ncertain tasks, are fundamentally driven by RLHF” (Touvron et al., 2023).\\nReward model\\nRLHF relies on a reward model. Given a pair of (prompt, response), the\\nreward model outputs a score for how good the response is. Training a\\nmodel to score a given input is a common ML task. The challenge, similar\\nto that of SFT, is to obtain reliable data. If we ask labelers to score each\\nresponse directly, the scores will vary. For the same sample, on a 10-point\\nscale, one labeler might give a 5 and another 7. Even the same labeler,\\ngiven the same pair of (prompt, response) twice, might give different\\nscores. Evaluating each sample independently is also called pointwise\\nevaluation.'),\n",

With the introduction of\\nfoundation models, evaluation has become even more so. There are multiple\\nreasons why evaluating foundation models is more challenging than\\nevaluating traditional ML models.\\nFirst, the more intelligent AI models become, the harder it is to evaluate\\nthem. Most people can tell if a first grader’s math solution is wrong. Few\\ncan do the same for a PhD-level math solution. It’s easy to tell if a book\\nsummary is bad if it’s gibberish, but a lot harder if the summary is coherent.\\nTo validate the quality of a summary, you might need to read the book first.\\nThis brings us to a corollary: evaluation can be so much more time-\\nconsuming for sophisticated tasks. You can no longer evaluate a response\\n4'),\n",

You’ll also need to fact-check, reason, and even\\nincorporate domain expertise.\\nSecond, the open-ended nature of foundation models undermines the\\ntraditional approach of evaluating a model against ground truths. With\\ntraditional ML, most tasks are close-ended. For example, a classification\\nmodel can only output among the expected categories. To evaluate a\\nclassification model, you can evaluate its outputs against the expected\\noutputs. If the expected output is category X but the model’s output is\\ncategory Y, the model is wrong. However, for an open-ended task, for a\\ngiven input, there are so many possible correct responses. It’s impossible to\\ncurate a comprehensive list of correct outputs to compare against.\\nThird, most foundation models are treated as black boxes, either because\\nmodel providers choose not to expose models’ details, or because\\napplication developers lack the expertise to understand them. Details such\\nas the model architecture, training data, and the training process can reveal\\na lot about a model’s strengths and weaknesses. Without those details, you\\ncan evaluate only a model by observing its outputs.\\nAt the same time, publicly available evaluation benchmarks have proven to\\nbe inadequate for evaluating foundation models. Ideally, evaluation\\nbenchmarks should capture the full range of model capabilities. As AI\\nprogresses, benchmarks need to evolve to catch up. A benchmark becomes\\nsaturated for a model once the model achieves the perfect score. With'),\n",

For example, if you want to evaluate a model’s ability to do\\nmath, an open-ended approach is to ask the model to generate the solution\\nto a given problem. A close-ended approach is to give the model several\\noptions and let it pick the correct one. If the expected answer is option C\\nand the model outputs option A, the model is wrong.\\nThis is the approach that most public benchmarks follow. In April 2024,\\n75% of the tasks in Eleuther’s lm-evaluation-harness are multiple-choice,\\nincluding UC Berkeley’s MMLU (2020), Microsoft’s AGIEval (2023), and\\nthe AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC-C) (2018).

For example, for the Llama 3\\nchat model, Meta changed the template to the following:\\n<|begin_of_text|>\\n<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\\n{{ system_prompt }}<|eot_id|>\\n<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n{{ user_message }}<|eot_id|>\\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\nEach text span between <| and |>, such as <|begin_of_text|>\\nand <|start_header_id|>, is treated as a single token by the model.\\nAccidentally using the wrong template can lead to bewildering performance\\nissues. Small mistakes when using a template, such as an extra new line,\\ncan also cause the model to significantly change its behaviors.3'),\n",

Template errors are, unfortunately, very common. These errors are hard to spot\\nbecause they cause silent failures—the model will do something reasonable even if the template\\nis wrong.\\nBefore sending a query to a model, print out the final prompt to double-check if it follows the\\nexpected template.\\nMany model providers emphasize that well-crafted system prompts can\\nimprove performance. For example, Anthropic documentation says, “when\\nassigning Claude a specific role or personality through a system prompt, it\\ncan maintain that character more effectively throughout the conversation,\\nexhibiting more natural and creative responses while staying in character.”\\nBut why would system prompts boost performance compared to user\\nprompts? Under the hood, the system prompt and the user prompt are\\nconcatenated into a single final prompt before being fed into the model.\\nFrom the model’s perspective, system prompts and user prompts are\\nprocessed the same way.

A\\nheuristic is to include the documents that contain the term the greatest\\nnumber of times. The assumption is that the more a term appears in a\\ndocument, the more relevant this document is to this term. The number\\nof times a term appears in a document is called term frequency (TF).\\nA prompt can be long and contain many terms. Some are more important\\nthan others. For example, the prompt “Easy-to-follow recipes for\\nVietnamese food to cook at home” contains nine terms: easy-to-follow,\\nrecipes, for, vietnamese, food, to, cook, at, home.

Four tactics discussed here are chunking strategy,\\nreranking, query rewriting, and contextual retrieval.\\nChunking strategy\\nHow your data should be indexed depends on how you intend to retrieve it\\nlater. The last section covered different retrieval algorithms and their\\nrespective indexing strategies. There, the discussion was based on the\\nassumption that documents have already been split into manageable chunks.\\nIn this section, I’ll cover different chunking strategies.

Common units are characters, words, sentences, and\\nparagraphs. For example, you can split each document into chunks of 2,048\\ncharacters or 512 words. You can also split each document so that each\\nchunk can contain a fixed number of sentences (such as 20 sentences) or\\nparagraphs (such as each paragraph is its own chunk).\\nYou can also split documents recursively using increasingly smaller units\\nuntil each chunk fits within your maximum chunk size. For example, you\\ncan start by splitting a document into sections. If a section is too long, split\\nit into paragraphs. If a paragraph is still too long, split it into sentences. This\\nreduces the chance of related texts being arbitrarily broken off.\\nSpecific documents might also support creative chunking strategies. For\\nexample, there are splitters developed especially for different programming\\nlanguages. Q&A documents can be split by question or answer pair, where\\neach pair makes up a chunk. Chinese texts might need to be split differently\\nfrom English texts.\\nWhen a document is split into chunks without overlap, the chunks might be\\ncut off in the middle of important context, leading to the loss of critical\\ninformation. Consider the text “I left my wife a note”. If it’s split into “I left'),\n",

Overlapping ensures that important\\nboundary information is included in at least one chunk. If you set the chunk\\nsize to be 2,048 characters, you can perhaps set the overlapping size to be\\n20 characters.\\nThe chunk size shouldn’t exceed the maximum context length of the\\ngenerative model. For the embedding-based approach, the chunk size also\\nshouldn’t exceed the embedding model’s context limit.\\nYou can also chunk documents using tokens, determined by the generative\\nmodel’s tokenizer, as a unit. Let’s say that you want to use Llama 3 as your\\ngenerative model. You then first tokenize documents using Llama 3’s\\ntokenizer. You can then split documents into chunks using tokens as the\\nboundaries. Chunking by tokens makes it easier to work with downstream\\nmodels. However, the downside of this approach is that if you switch to\\nanother generative model with a different tokenizer, you’d need to reindex\\nyour data.\\nRegardless of which strategy you choose, chunk sizes matter. A smaller\\nchunk size allows for more diverse information. Smaller chunks mean that\\nyou can fit more chunks into the model’s context. If you halve the chunk\\nsize, you can fit twice as many chunks. More chunks can provide a model\\nwith a wider range of information, which can enable the model to produce a\\nbetter answer.'),\n",

Other than the failure\\nmodes common to all AI applications discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, agents\\nalso have unique failures caused by planning, tool execution, and efficiency.\\nSome of the failures are easier to catch than others.\\nTo evaluate an agent, identify its failure modes and measure how often each\\nof these failure modes happens.'),\n",

The agent might plan a trip from San Francisco to Ho Chi\\nMinh City, or plan a two-week trip from San Francisco to Hanoi that will be\\nway over the budget.\\nA common constraint that is often overlooked by agent evaluation is time.\\nIn many cases, the time an agent takes matters less, because you can assign\\na task to an agent and only need to check in when it’s done. However, in\\nmany cases, the agent becomes less useful with time. For example, if you\\nask an agent to prepare a grant proposal and the agent finishes it after the\\ngrant deadline, the agent isn’t very helpful.\\nAn interesting mode of planning failure is caused by errors in reflection.\\nThe agent is convinced that it’s accomplished a task when it hasn’t.

However, it is most often used\\nto improve the model’s instruction-following ability, particularly to ensure\\nit adheres to specific output styles and formats.\\nWhile finetuning can help create models that are more customized to your\\nneeds, it also requires more up-front investment. A question I hear very\\noften is when to finetune and when to do RAG. After an overview of\\nfinetuning, this chapter will discuss the reasons for finetuning and the\\nreasons for not finetuning, as well as a simple framework for thinking about\\nchoosing between finetuning and alternate methods.\\nCompared to prompt-based methods, finetuning incurs a much higher\\nmemory footprint. At the scale of today’s foundation models, naive\\nfinetuning often requires more memory than what’s available on a single\\nGPU. This makes finetuning expensive and challenging to do. As discussed\\nthroughout this chapter, reducing memory requirements is a primary'),\n",

Transfer learning focuses on how to\\ntransfer the knowledge gained from one task to accelerate learning for a\\nnew, related task. This is conceptually similar to how humans transfer\\nskills: for example, knowing how to play the piano can make it easier to\\nlearn another musical instrument.\\nAn early large-scale success in transfer learning was Google’s multilingual\\ntranslation system (Johnson et. al, 2016). The model transferred its\\nknowledge of Portuguese–English and English–Spanish translation to\\ndirectly translate Portuguese to Spanish, even though there were no\\nPortuguese–Spanish examples in the training data.\\nSince the early days of deep learning, transfer learning has offered a\\nsolution for tasks with limited or expensive training data.

Another approach is feature-based transfer. In\\nthis approach, a model is trained to extract features from the data, usually as embedding vectors,\\nwhich are then used by another model. I mention feature-based transfer briefly in Chapter 2, when\\ndiscussing how part of a foundation model can be reused for a classification task by adding a\\nclassifier head.\\nFeature-based transfer is very common in computer vision. For instance, in the second half of the\\n2010s, many people used models trained on the ImagetNet dataset to extract features from images\\nand use these features in other computer vision tasks such as object detection or image segmentation.\\nFinetuning is part of a model’s training process. It’s an extension of model\\npre-training. Because any training that happens after pre-training is\\nfinetuning, finetuning can take many different forms. Chapter 2 already\\ndiscussed two types of finetuning: supervised finetuning and preference\\nfinetuning. Let’s do a quick recap of these methods and how you might\\nleverage them as an application developer.\\nRecall that a model’s training process starts with pre-training, which is\\nusually done with self-supervision. Self-supervision allows the model to\\nlearn from a large amount of unlabeled data. For language models, self-\\nsupervised data is typically just sequences of text that don’t need\\nannotations.\\nBefore finetuning this pre-trained model with expensive task-specific data,\\nyou can finetune it with self-supervision using cheap task-related data.

Self-supervised finetuning is also called\\ncontinued pre-training.\\nAs discussed in Chapter 1, language models can be autoregressive or\\nmasked. An autoregressive model predicts the next token in a sequence\\nusing the previous tokens as the context. A masked model fills in the blank\\nusing the tokens both before and after it. Similarly, with supervised\\nfinetuning, you can also finetune a model to predict the next token or fill in\\nthe blank.

The memory\\nneeded for finetuning is typically much higher than the memory needed\\nfor inference because of the way neural networks are trained.\\n2. The key contributors to a model’s memory footprint during finetuning\\nare its number of parameters, its number of trainable parameters, and its\\nnumerical representations.\\n3. The more trainable parameters, the higher the memory footprint. You can\\nreduce memory requirement for finetuning by reducing the number of\\ntrainable parameters. Reducing the number of trainable parameters is the\\nmotivation for PEFT, parameter-efficient finetuning.\\n4. Quantization refers to the practice of converting a model from a format\\nwith more bits to a format with fewer bits. Quantization is a\\nstraightforward and efficient way to reduce a model’s memory footprint.\\nFor a model of 13 billion parameters, using FP32 means 4 bytes per\\nweight or 52 GB for the whole weights.

AI models are\\nprobabilistic, which means that if you try a query again, you might get a\\ndifferent response. For example, if the response is empty, try again X times\\nor until you get a nonempty response.

Reduce Latency with Caches\\nCaching has long been integral to software applications to reduce latency\\nand cost. Many ideas from software caching can be used for AI\\napplications. Inference caching techniques, including KV caching and\\nprompt caching, are discussed in Chapter 9. This section focuses on system\\ncaching. Because caching is an old technology with a large amount of\\nexisting literature, this book will cover it only in broad strokes. In general,\\nthere are two major system caching mechanisms: exact caching and\\nsemantic caching.\\nExact caching\\nWith exact caching, cached items are used only when these exact items are\\nrequested. For example, if a user asks a model to summarize a product, the\\nsystem checks the cache to see if a summary of this exact product exists. If\\nyes, fetch this summary. If not, summarize the product and cache the\\nsummary.\\nExact caching is also used for embedding-based retrieval to avoid\\nredundant vector search. If an incoming query is already in the vector\\nsearch cache, fetch the cached result. If not, perform a vector search for this\\nquery and cache the result.\\nCaching is especially appealing for queries that involve multiple steps (e.g.,\\nchain-of-thought) and/or time-consuming actions (e.g., retrieval, SQL'),\n",

However, since in-memory storage is limited, a cache can also be\\nimplemented using databases like PostgreSQL, Redis, or tiered storage to\\nbalance speed and storage capacity. Having an eviction policy is crucial to\\nmanage the cache size and maintain performance. Common eviction\\npolicies include Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU),\\nand first in, first out (FIFO).\\nHow long to keep a query in the cache depends on how likely this query is\\nto be called again. User-specific queries, such as “What’s the status of my\\nrecent order?”, are less likely to be reused by other users and, therefore,\\nshouldn’t be cached. Similarly, it makes less sense to cache time-sensitive\\nqueries such as “How’s the weather?” Many teams train a classifier to\\npredict whether a query should be cached.\\nWARNING\\nCaching, when not properly handled, can cause data leaks. Imagine you work for an ecommerce site,\\nand user X asks a seemingly generic question such as: “What is the return policy for electronics\\nproducts?” Because your return policy depends on the user’s membership, the system first retrieves\\nuser X’s information and then generates a response containing X’s information.

This bird was commonly\\nknown as Hume’s owl and it was thought to be widespread throughout the\\nMiddle East.\\nIn 2013, a previously unknown species of owl was discovered in Oman and\\ngiven the name Strix omanensis, the Omani owl. No physical specimen was\\ncollected, but the owl was described from photographs and sound\\nrecordings. Then, in 2015, an analysis of the Strix butleri holotype (the\\noriginal specimen found in 1878) revealed that the owl was actually the\\nsame as Strix omanensis, and distinct from the more common owl found\\nthroughout the Middle East. Following naming conventions, the species\\nkept the original name Strix butleri and the more common owl was given\\nthe name Strix hadorami, the desert owl.\\nThe Omani owl has a pale and dark gray face and orange eyes. Its\\nupperparts are a dark grayish brown and its underparts are pale gray with\\nnarrow dark streaks. It’s a medium-sized owl with a round head and no ear\\ntufts. As a relatively new discovery, ornithologists are still researching the\\nowl’s behavior, ecology, and distribution.'),\n",
